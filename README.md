Python Object Orientation course
================================

Material in this repository is created for the purpose of teaching the concepts of object orientation using Python. It forms the material of a [short course](https://cmg.soton.ac.uk/events/event-901/) delivered at the University of Southampton's Doctoral Festival, and is also used in the [NGCM Summer Academy Basics B](http://ngcm.soton.ac.uk/summer-academy/basics.html) Material. 

The concepts of OOP are often covered lightly in undergraduate and basics courses, however large amounts of scientific Python packages are written in an object oriented manner. The skills learned in this workshop should therefore enable scientists to write (and more importantly, read) the packages they are using, and also serve as a starting platform for those wanting to learn more advanced OOP languages such as C++ or Java.

The following topics will be covered in the context of OOP in Python:

* Classes
* Python 2.X vs 3.X
* Initialization and init
* self
* Encapsulation
* Inheritance
* Magic operators

Prior knowledge of programming in Python is assumed, including e.g. lists, for loops, conditionals, numpy and matplotlib. See [here](http://ngcm.github.io/summer-academy-2016-basics/basics_A/) for useful reference.

Getting Started
---------------
Teaching material is largely in Jupyter Notebook format, and can be followed in several ways (in order of preference):

1. Cloning this repository with 

  > `git clone https://github.com/ngcm/summer-academy-2016.git`

  and viewing the 'Index.ipynb' as a live notebook slideshow with

  > `jupyter notebook Index.ipynb`

  This requires the [RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE) package to be installed.

2. Clone and view the `Index.ipynb` slides (as in 1.) as a raw notebook (`View > Cell Toolbar > Raw Cell Format`)

3. Clone (as in 1.) and view the static html slideshow with

  > `make serve`

4. Viewing directly on Github (not recommended)
